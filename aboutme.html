	<p>Hi my name is Jasmine Dhillon and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from the San Francisco Bay Area.
	In high school, I played soccer for both my high school and the city team. Throughout my nine years of competative soccer, I played teams from all over California, the United States, and even Canada and England! My hobbies include both watching and playing sports, fashion, and exercising. </p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I have recently joined the Society of Women Engineers: Teach Tech committee. We have brand new interdisciplinary engineering project starting very soon!  I am also a member of WCS (Women in Computer Science), and the ACM special interest group Webmonkey (build HTML, Javascript, CSS projects), in addition to my academic courses. Overall, I am proficient in Python and advancing on my Java skills everyday! </p>
